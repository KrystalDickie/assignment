            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My name is <em>Krystal Dickie</em>, I am 24 years old and live in Ottawa, Ontario. I have a <strong>large</strong> rescue dog and two elderly ferrets. My dog's name is Dexter, I adopted him from the Ottawa Humane Society when he was only 3 years old, he just turned 7 years old in fall of <sup>2020</sup>. My ferrets are named Joey and Smeagol, they also recently turned 7 years old. I adopted them from someone online when they were only 1 year and a half.</p>
            <p>Other than my animals my other interests include visual arts and design, fashion, hairstyling, video games, photography, aerial arts and generally anything that allows me to create. Hence my interest in the Interactive Media Design program, it has many different avenues that interest me and I hope I can make a career from. </p>
